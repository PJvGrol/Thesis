\chapter{Related Work}
Boneh, Drijvers and Neven in \cite{BLSMulti} have devised a multisignature scheme using the signature scheme described by Boneh, Lynn and Sacham in \cite{BLS}. The work in \cite{BLSMulti} desribes an efficient multisignature scheme and links it to use in Bitcoin, but is at its core an efficient algorithm.

Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Yannick Seurin and Pieter Wuille in \cite{SchnorrMulti} describe another multisignature scheme to be applied in Bitcoin, based on the well known Schnorr signature schemes. Their work descirbes a scheme that is simple and efficient and allows key aggregation to create a joint signature.

This thesis focuses on comparing the two algorithms, in particular regarding performance, and is as such a link between the two works, allowing consideration over the choice of one scheme over the other.

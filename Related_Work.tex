\chapter{Related Work}
Boneh, Drijvers and Neven in \cite{BLSMulti} have devised a multi-signature scheme using the signature scheme described by Boneh, Lynn and Sacham in \cite{BLS}. The work in \cite{BLSMulti} describes an efficient multi-signature scheme and links it to use in Bitcoin, but is at its core an efficient algorithm.

Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Yannick Seurin and Pieter Wuille in \cite{SchnorrMulti} describe another multi-signature scheme to be applied in Bitcoin, based on the well known Schnorr signature schemes. Their work describes a scheme that is simple and efficient and allows key aggregation to create a joint signature.

This thesis focuses on comparing the two algorithms, in particular regarding performance, and is as such a link between the two works, allowing consideration over the choice of one scheme over the other.
